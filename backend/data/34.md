## Own Your Earned Salary

The OYES (Own Your Earned Salary) platform offers a multifaceted strategy to address the daily financial challenges of employees with limited access to low-cost financing and the need for daily access to their earned wages. By reducing dependency on high-interest loan sources, OYES allows employees to access their daily earned salary at any time, ensuring sustainability and scalability while integrating seamlessly with employersâ€™ HRIS systems. This solution is particularly vital as many employees face diverse financial needs, including managing household expenses, childcare costs, unexpected bills, and bridging paycheck gaps, making traditional loans and credit cards prohibitively expensive and leading to debt cycles. OYES promotes financial inclusion by providing access to formal financial services, especially for blue-collar workers, during urgent financial needs.
