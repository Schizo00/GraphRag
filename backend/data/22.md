# Hutch completes successful implementation of advanced Oracle Cloud ERP system

Hutch, Sri Lanka’s fastest-growing mobile broadband operator, accomplished yet another major milestone in its rapid transformation journey, successfully implementing the latest Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the middle of the COVID pandemic.

Most legacy ERP systems, including Oracle, are fully deployed on-premises but now technology is moving toward the cloud and Hutch decided to leap forward and implement a future-proof Oracle Cloud ERP.

The project was facilitated by Hutch Sri Lanka’s parent CK Hutchison group, through its global innovations arm CKH-IOD and spearheaded by LOLC Technologies Limited partnered with EVOSYS Global, an International Platinum Partner for Oracle. Hutch also partnered with PWC-Sri Lanka in the process to acquire expert consultancy services on this programme.

Hutch Chief Financial Officer Lalith Fernando commented, “The implementation of the Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP system will allow us to transform the business to help achieve our goals while adhering to global best practices. The Oracle ERP system is a complete, modern, cloud ERP suite that offers us advanced capabilities, such as AI to automate the manual processes, analytics to react to market shifts in real-time and automatic updates to stay current and gain a competitive advantage.

The successful on-time implementation of this ERP system was all the more impressive, as it has been executed almost in its entirety during the COVID pandemic, which did not allow full on-premise project execution by vendors and project consultants.”
